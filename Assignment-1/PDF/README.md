## PDF Selection Rationale

I have chosen a PDF document that provides comprehensive information about web technologies. This resource is valuable for students, as it facilitates easy querying and enhances the learning process. The content is well-structured and suitable for parsing, making it ideal for integration with the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model. By utilizing this PDF, students will have access to relevant information, enabling them to ask insightful questions and engage more effectively with the material.

## Implementation Details

Certainly! Here are the implementation details for your Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using the provided code:

### 1. Environment Setup

- **Dependencies**: Ensure that you have the necessary libraries installed. You can use the following command to install them (if not already installed):
  ```bash
  pip install llama-index qdrant-client python-dotenv
  ```

- **Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file in your project directory containing the following:
  ```plaintext
  JINA_API_KEY=your_jina_api_key
  GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
  ```

### 2. Code Overview

- **Importing Libraries**:
  The code imports essential modules from `llama_index` for handling vector storage, embeddings, and LLM integration, along with `QdrantClient` for managing the Qdrant vector store.

- **Loading Environment Variables**:
  Using `dotenv`, the code loads API keys for Jina and Groq from a `.env` file.

### 3. Configuration of Models

- **Embedding Model**: 
  The embedding model is configured to use Jina's embedding for passage retrieval:
  ```python
  Settings.embed_model = JinaEmbedding(
      api_key=os.getenv("JINA_API_KEY"),
      model="jina-embeddings-v3",
      task="retrieval.passage",
  )
  ```

- **LLM Configuration**: 
  The language model is set up using Groq:
  ```python
  Settings.llm = Groq(
      api_key=os.getenv("GROQ_API_KEY"),
      model="gemma-7b-it",
      temperature=0.7
  )
  ```

### 4. Creating the RAG System

- **Function: `create_rag_system(data_dir="./data")`**:
  - Initializes a Qdrant client.
  - Creates a Qdrant vector store for storing embeddings.
  - Loads documents from the specified directory using `SimpleDirectoryReader`.
  - Constructs a vector store index with the loaded documents.
  - Returns a query engine for querying the index.

### 5. Querying the RAG System

- **Function: `query_rag(query_engine, question: str)`**:
  - Takes a question as input and queries the RAG system using the provided query engine.
  - Returns the response.

### 6. Main Functionality

- **Function: `main()`**:
  - Initializes the RAG system by calling `create_rag_system()`.
  - Enters a loop, prompting the user for questions until 'quit' is entered.
  - Uses `query_rag()` to process each question and print the response.

### 7. Execution

- The script is executed when run as the main program:
  ```python
  if __name__ == "__main__":
      main()
  ```

## Usage

1. Place your relevant PDF documents in the `./data` directory.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python your_script_name.py
   ```
3. Interact with the console to ask questions related to the content of the PDF documents.

## Notes

- Make sure that the documents loaded are suitable for embedding and querying.
- The embedding dimension in the `QdrantVectorStore` configuration must match the output dimension of the Jina embedding model.

## Model Comparison

### 1. llama-3.1-70b-versatile

- Appears as a versatile model, suggesting it is designed for broad applications.
- Likely has a high parameter count, given the “70b” (billion) in its name.
- Mentioned under both PDF and website sections, indicating it may be widely available or documented.

### 2. mixtral-8x7b-32768

- Features “8x7b,” which could imply multiple instances or clustering of 7 billion parameters.
- “32768” might suggest either a model configuration or a token length capability.
- Also listed in both PDF and website sections, implying multi-platform accessibility.

### 3. gemma-7b-it

- The model name includes “7b,” indicating 7 billion parameters.
- The “it” suffix might imply specialization for Italian language or specific industry applications.
- Listed under the PDF section only, possibly indicating limited platform availability.

## Sample Question-Answer Responses

- **Question**: What is JSON?  
  **Answer**: JSON is a text-file format that stores structured data in a map format, using key-value pairs. It is just a data format written in JavaScript, not a programming language.

- **Question**: How is JSON different from jQuery?  
  **Answer**: JSON and jQuery are two completely different technologies. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a data format that stores data in a map format (key/value pairs), whereas jQuery is a JavaScript library that simplifies the process of interacting with and manipulating HTML documents.

- **Question**: List some HTML attributes.  
  **Answer**: controls, loop, muted, played, preload, src, volume.

- **Question**: What is Canvas?  
  **Answer**: Canvas allows you to render graphics powered by JavaScript. It can be used for animation, game graphics, data visualization, photo manipulation, and real-time video processing.

- **Question**: XML vs JSON?  
  **Answer**: XML and JSON are two text-file formats used to store structured data. XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a markup language providing a clear structure to data, while JSON stores data in a map format using key-value pairs, making it easier to comprehend.

- **Question**: Tell something about HTML5 Geolocation API.  
  **Answer**: The HTML5 Geolocation API helps in identifying the user's location, which can be used to provide location-specific information or route navigation details to the user. This API protects the user's privacy by mandating that user permission should be sought and obtained before sending the location information of the user to any website. As a result, the user will be prompted with a popover or dialog requesting permission to share their location information. The current location of the user can be obtained using the getCurrentPosition function of the navigator.geolocation object, which accepts three parameters: success callback function, error callback function, and position options.

- **Question**: What are the types of web workers?  
  **Answer**: There are two types of web workers: Dedicated Workers and Shared Workers.

  Dedicated Workers are instantiated by the main process and can only communicate with it. A dedicated worker is only accessible by the script that called it.

  Shared Workers can be reached by all processes running on the same origin, such as different browser tabs, iframes, or other shared workers. A shared worker is accessible by multiple scripts.

- **Question**: List some jQuery selectors.  
  **Answer**: Based on the provided information, some jQuery selectors are:
  1. Element selector
  2. ID selector (#)
  3. Class selector (.)

- **Question**: What are the three states of a promise?  
  **Answer**: A Promise has 3 possible states - Pending, Fulfilled, and Rejected.

- **Question**: What is AJAX?  
  **Answer**: AJAX is not a full-fledged programming language but rather a combination of technologies used to create interactive web pages. It cannot work independently and relies on other technologies such as JavaScript, DOM, CSS, and XMLHttpRequest to function.

- **Question**: Give syntax for jQuery selector.  
  **Answer**: The syntax for jQuery selectors is: $().

- **Question**: What is MERN?  
  **Answer**: MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React, and Node. It is an acronym that represents a combination of technologies used for web development, including a document database (MongoDB), a Node.js web framework (Express), a client-side JavaScript library (React), and a JavaScript web server (Node).

- **Question**: How is React.js related to MERN?  
  **Answer**: React.js is a part of the MERN stack. MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React, and Node. In this stack, React.js is a client-side JavaScript library used for building UI and UI components, specifically for the frontend of the application.

- **Question**: What is single way data flow?  
  **Answer**: The provided context does not explicitly mention single way data flow. However, it mentions that two wires are used to carry data and that different signaling schemes are used for different speeds of transmission.

- **Question**: What is a stateful component?  
  **Answer**: A Stateful component is a type of React component that is a class which extends the Component class from React library. The class component must include the render method which returns HTML.

- **Question**: What is NON-JSX?  
  **Answer**: There is no information provided about NON-JSX or JSX in the given context. However, it does mention 'JavaScript Object Notation' which is related to JavaScript.
